############coin change problem (does not give right solution)
def coin_change_greedy(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort coins in descending order
    count = 0  # To count the number of coins used
    for coin in coins:
        if amount == 0:
            break
        # Use as many coins of this denomination as possible
        count += amount // coin
        amount %= coin  # Update the remaining amount
    return count if amount == 0 else -1  # Return -1 if amount cannot be formed

# Example usage
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]  # Denominations
amount = 63
print(coin_change_greedy(coins, amount))  # Output: 6 (25+25+10+1+1+1)


---Can Backtracking Always Be Solved by Greedy?

-------No. Backtracking problems often do not meet the criteria for greedy algorithms because:

----------Backtracking explores all paths systematically, while greedy takes only one path.
----------Greedy fails when the locally optimal choice leads to suboptimal solutions.
